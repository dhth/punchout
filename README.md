```

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

`punchout` can receive its configuration via command line flags, or a config
file.

### Using a config file

Create a toml file that looks like the following. The default location for this
file is `~/.config/punchout/punchout.toml`. The configuration needed for
authenticating against your JIRA installation (on-premise or cloud) will depend
on the kind of the installation.

```toml
[jira]
jira_url = "https://jira.company.com"

# for on-premise installations
installation_type = "onpremise"
jira_token = "your personal access token"

# for cloud installations
installation_type = "cloud"
jira_token = "your API token"
jira_username = "example@example.com"

# put whatever JQL you want to query for
jql = "assignee = currentUser() AND updatedDate >= -14d ORDER BY updatedDate DESC"

# I don't know how many people will find use for this.
# I need this, since the JIRA on-premise server I use runs 5 hours behind
# the actual time, for whatever reason ü§∑
jira_time_delta_mins = 300
```

### Basic usage

Use `punchout -h` for help.

```bash
punchout \
    -db-path='/path/to/punchout/db/file.db' \
    -jira-url='https://jira.company.com' \
    -jira-installation-type 'onpremise' \
    -jira-token='XXX' \
    -jql='assignee = currentUser() AND updatedDate >= -14d ORDER BY updatedDate DESC'

punchout \
    -db-path='/path/to/punchout/db/file.db' \
    -jira-url='https://jira.company.com' \
    -jira-installation-type 'cloud' \
    -jira-token='XXX' \
    -jira-username='example@example.com' \
    -jql='assignee = currentUser() AND updatedDate >= -14d ORDER BY updatedDate DESC'
```

Both the config file and the command line flags can be used in conjunction, but
the latter will take precedence over the former.

```bash
punchout \
    -config-file-path='/path/to/punchout/config/file.toml' \
    -jira-token='XXX' \
    -jql='assignee = currentUser() AND updatedDate >= -14d ORDER BY updatedDate DESC'
```
