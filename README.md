‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

`punchout` can receive its configuration via command line flags, or a config
file.

### Using a config file

Create a toml file that looks like the following. The default location for this
file is `~/.config/punchout/punchout.toml`.

```toml
[jira]
jira_url = "https://jira.company.com"

# for on-premise installations
# you can use a JIRA PAT token here:
# jira_token = "XXX"

# or if you use cloud instance
# use your jira username and API token:
# jira_cloud_username = "example@example.com"
# jira_cloud_token = "XXX"

# put whatever JQL you want to query for
jql = "assignee = currentUser() AND updatedDate >= -14d ORDER BY updatedDate DESC"

# I don't know how many people will find use for this.
# I need this, since the JIRA server I use runs 5 hours behind
# the actual time, for whatever reason ü§∑
# jira_time_delta_mins = 300
```

### Using command line flags

Use `punchout -h` for help.

```bash
punchout \
    [ -db-path='/path/to/punchout/db/file.db' ] \
    [ -jira-url='https://jira.company.com' ] \
    [ -jira-token='XXX' | { jira-cloud-token='XXX' jira-cloud-username='example@example.com' } ] \
    [ -jql='assignee = currentUser() AND updatedDate >= -14d ORDER BY updatedDate DESC' ] \
    [ -jira-time-delta-mins='300' ] \
    [ -config-file-path='/path/to/punchout/config/file.toml' ] \
    [ -list-config ]
```

Both the config file and the command line flags can be used in conjunction, but
the latter will take precedence over the former.

```bash
punchout \
    -config-file-path='/path/to/punchout/config/file.toml' \
    -jira-token='XXX' \
    -jql='assignee = currentUser() AND updatedDate >= -14d ORDER BY updatedDate DESC'
```
